    "- max error: The max error between the predicted and the true values.\n",
    "- Mean root squared error: The mean root squared error between the predicted and the true values.\n",
    "- Out-of-boundary rate: The percentage that the residual error between the predicted and the true values is larger than a given threshold. Here, we set the thresold to be $3$ degree."
